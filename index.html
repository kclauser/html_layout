        <p>Welcome to my autocross website. I made this website about autocross because I didn't know what else to make it about. Autocross is the art of dodging cones. Its a lot like Formula One except the cars are slower, theres no wheel to wheel racing, you don't really go over 60/70mph, and we race in parking lots and runways instead of race tracks. Ok so its nothing like Formula One, it does have more inputs per second than Forumla One though, and its fun!
